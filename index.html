    <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
    <p>Chess is a board game of strategic skill for two players, played on a checkered board. Finding its origins from the 6th century, chess has evolved over centuries into the refined game it is today. The board consists of 64 total squares, colored black and white in a checkered pattern. Each player starts the game with sixteen pieces, including pawns, knights, rooks, bishops, kings, and queens. Each piece is moved and used to capture opposing pieces according to specific rules. The goal of the game is to put the opponent's king under checkmate - an attack from which escape is impossible.</p><br>

    <h2>Rules of Chess</h2>
    <p>Chess is a relatively simple game to learn, but an incredibly hard game to master. Here are the basic rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player starts with 16 pieces total: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king. Each chess piece moves according to unique rules, which can be found <a href=https://www.ichess.net/blog/chess-pieces-moves/>here</a>.</li>
        <li>White always goes first.</li>
        <li>The game ends when one king gets checkmated, or when there is a stalemate.</li>
        <li>Each player moves a single piece each turn.</li>
        <li>You can't capture your own pieces (Your pieces can't overlap).</li>
        <li>You can promote a pawn into any piece you want by bringing it to the opposite side of the board it started on.</li>
        <li>There is a rule called en passant that you can learn about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant>here</a></li>
