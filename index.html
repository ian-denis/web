    <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
    <p>Chess is a board game of strategic skill for two players, played on a checkered board. The board consists of 64 total squares, colored black and white in a checkered pattern. Each player starts the game with sixteen pieces, including pawns, knights, rooks, bishops, kings, and queens. Each piece is moved and used to capture opposing pieces according to specific rules. The goal of the game is to put the opponent's king under checkmate - an attack from which escape is impossible.</p><br>
